# Everyday Recipes App
- Cooking can be an incredible experience but it can also be incredibly frustrating. Surfing through old cookbooks with stained hard to read recipe cards can be exhausting and take all the joy out of the kitchen. This was the issue posed to me by my partner, Kelsey. She wanted a way to store and access her favorite recipes in a one stop location. Enter Everyday Recipes, an easy to use recipe app that allows a user to add, store, edit, delete, the recipes they love.  The app is designed, tried and tested by developers and users alike who are every day at home cooks.
